# simulated-annealing4Function


## Description

This project implements the **Simulated Annealing** algorithm to find the global minimum of a mathematical function.  
The goal is to demonstrate how this algorithm can escape local minima and approach the global minimum using a process inspired by the cooling of metals.

## Features

- Implementation of the Simulated Annealing algorithm  
- Minimization of a user-defined function (in this project it's the f(x)=x^2 function)  
- Adjustable parameters: initial temperature, cooling rate, number of iterations  
- Result visualization
